/**
 * The extension-type catalog, rendered for an agent building an extension.
 *
 * Why a tool and not documentation: an agent asked to "build a Chrome extension
 * that helps fill forms" has to decide a shape before it writes a line, and the
 * decision it makes badly is permissions — either padding the manifest to look
 * capable, or missing the one key without which the chosen shape cannot work.
 * This hands it the four shapes with their REQUIRED permissions attached, so the
 * minimum is the easy path rather than the researched one.
 *
 * Free and keyless by construction: the catalog is compiled in, so this answers
 * without touching the BFF, without an API key, and without spending a credit —
 * the same reasoning as `search_docs`.
