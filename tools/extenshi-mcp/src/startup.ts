/**
 * "A real MCP client launched this server" — the signal `mcp_installed` is not.
 *
 * Why this exists: `mcp_installed` fires from scripts/postinstall.cjs the moment
 * npm extracts the tarball, so it counts every machine that INSTALLS the
 * package, whether or not anything ever runs the binary. Measured over the
 * package's lifetime on 2026-08-08, that population is overwhelmingly automated:
 * 107 of 109 install-reporting machines installed exactly one version, exactly
 * once, and were never seen again; 88 of 122 install events were linux/x64
 * across nine different Node majors, arriving within days of each publish. None
 * of them ever emitted a tool call. That is the signature of npm-ecosystem
 * scanners and mirrors, not of developers — so an "activation rate" computed as
 * tool-callers ÷ installers measures robots, and reads as a product failure.
 *
 * A scanner sandbox runs `npm install` and stops there. An MCP client, by
 * construction, EXECUTES the binary — so this event, emitted once per server
 * process, is the honest denominator for "installed → actually used". Pair it
 * with `mcp_tool_called` for a funnel whose numerator and denominator describe
 * the same population.
 *
 * `has_api_key` is a boolean and never the key itself. It answers, at the
 * population level, the question this funnel cannot otherwise settle: of the
 * servers that really start, how many are configured well enough to be useful.
 * Every read/scan tool refuses without a key (see MISSING_KEY_MESSAGE), so a
 * high started-but-keyless share is an onboarding problem, not a demand problem.
 *
 * Privacy is unchanged from ./telemetry.ts: one boolean on top of the anonymous
 * base properties. No path, no key, no user input.
