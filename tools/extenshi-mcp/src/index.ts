/**
 * @extenshi/mcp — Model Context Protocol server for extension developers.
 *
 * Runs locally over stdio inside an MCP client (Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor)
 * and exposes the Extenshi catalog as tools: market-research reads against the
 * public BFF, plus a paid `scan_extension` that reuses the CLI scan path, and a
 * local `publish_extension`.
 *
 * The TOOLS themselves live in `tools.ts` (transport-agnostic) so the sibling
 * remote OAuth server (`@extenshi/mcp-server`) reuses the exact same registry.
 * This file is just the stdio wiring: it injects deps that resolve identity
 * from the environment (one `ek_…` key) and enables ALL capabilities.
 *
 * Auth: an `ek_…` API key is REQUIRED. Over stdio there are no request headers,
 * so the key comes from the environment (EXTENSHI_API_KEY) / `~/.extenshi`
 * config — see config.ts. The backend independently enforces the key, so this
 * is defense in depth, not the only gate.
 *
 * NB: stdout is the MCP protocol channel — never write to it (use stderr).
