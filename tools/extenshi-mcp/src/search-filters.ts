/**
 * Cross-store filter validation for `search_extensions`.
 *
 * Some catalog filters are backed by STORE-SPECIFIC metrics, so combining them
 * with a `stores` filter that excludes every store reporting that metric yields
 * a silently-empty (or misleading) result set. We reject those combinations up
 * front with an actionable message instead of letting the caller "search half
 * the catalog and wonder why nothing matched".
 *
 * Field population (source of truth: catalog/scraper/src):
 *   - weeklyDownloads → Firefox ONLY (`addon.weekly_downloads`). Chrome reports
 *     install counts via `usersNumeric`; Edge via `activeInstallCount`; neither
 *     sets weeklyDownloads. There is no server-side min-usersNumeric filter, so
 *     for Chrome/Edge popularity the only lever is `sortBy: 'popular'`.
 *
 * Kept free of any `fastmcp` import so it stays unit-testable in isolation; the
 * caller (index.ts) turns a returned message into a `UserError`.
