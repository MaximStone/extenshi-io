/**
 * Transport-agnostic tool registry for the Extenshi MCP server.
 *
 * The SAME tool set must run over two transports:
 *   - stdio  (`index.ts`)  — local, single `ek_…` key from the environment.
 *   - remote (`http.ts`, in the sibling `@extenshi/mcp-server`) — Streamable
 *     HTTP behind OAuth; identity is per-request (an access token → userId).
 *
 * To keep ONE source of truth for what the tools do, every tool body here is
 * identity-agnostic: it resolves its catalog client / scan auth through the
 * injected `ToolDeps` instead of reaching for a module-global key. stdio passes
 * deps that ignore the call context and use the env key; the remote server
 * passes deps that read `context.session` (the validated OAuth identity).
 *
 * Capability gating: the remote connector deliberately exposes a SUBSET — the
 * read/research/docs tools only. `scan_extension` and `publish_extension` need
 * the caller's LOCAL filesystem and LOCAL store credentials, which a hosted
 * server has no access to (and must never store) — so they are registered only
 * when the corresponding capability is present (stdio enables all four).
 * See internal-docs/plans/2026-06-25-claude-connector-directory.md §13 #1.
 *
 *   capability → tools
 *   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   'read'    → search_extensions, get_extension, get_reviews,
 *               get_security, get_risk_by_store_ids, market_overview
 *   'docs'    → search_docs, generate_icon_workflow,
 *               generate_welcome_page_workflow        (free; no key)
 *   'scan'    → scan_extension             (local artifact; stdio only)
 *   'publish' → publish_extension          (local creds; stdio only)
 *
 * stdout is the MCP protocol channel for stdio — nothing here may write to it.

 * A `UserError` that keeps the error it renders as `cause`.

 * missing `cause` as "a message we authored" — i.e. expected — so a hand-rolled
 * wrapper silently drops whatever it caught (a BFF 5xx, a TypeError) from error
 * tracking. That's the bug this helper exists to prevent; the convention is not
 * enforced by the type system, so it lives here and in isExpectedError().
 *
 * Two fastmcp details force this to be a helper rather than
 * `new UserError(msg, { cause })`:
 *  1. `UserError`'s constructor is `(message, extras?)` and passes ONLY the
 *     message to `super()` — an `ErrorOptions` second argument is silently
 *     dropped, so `.cause` would stay undefined.
 *  2. `extras` is not a place to stash the origin either: fastmcp spreads it
 *     into the tool result as `structuredContent`, which would ship the raw
 *     error (stack, internal URLs) to the caller.
 * So set `cause` on the instance. fastmcp never reads it, so nothing leaks — but
 * classifyError()/isExpectedError() can see the origin behind the rendered
 * message instead of guessing from its wording.
