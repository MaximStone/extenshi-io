/**
 * Anonymous install ping — VENDORED, kept byte-identical between @extenshi/cli
 * and @extenshi/mcp (it figures out which one it is from its own package.json).
 *
 * Fires a single `cli_installed` / `mcp_installed` event when the package is
 * installed as a real dependency ON A MACHINE THAT HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED
 * telemetry, so we can see adoption in PostHog. It is a standalone CommonJS
 * script using ONLY Node built-ins (no posthog-node, no build step) so it can
 * run the instant npm extracts the tarball.
 *
 * Hard rules (a postinstall that breaks `npm install` is unacceptable):
 *   - ALWAYS exits 0, even on any error — wrapped in try/catch + a hard timeout.
 *   - Fully fail-soft and fire-and-forget; the request is capped at ~2s.
 *
 * It self-skips (no event, no network) when:
 *   - the package is NOT under node_modules — i.e. our own monorepo workspace
 *     install (tools/<pkg>), so dev installs never inflate adoption counts;
 *   - ~/.extenshi/config.json does not hold "telemetry": true — consent must be
 *     RECORDED, not merely un-refused. A postinstall runs before the CLI can
 *     ask anything, so "no answer yet" is not permission (see the ACCEPTED-ONLY
 *     note below);
 *   - DO_NOT_TRACK is truthy or EXTENSHI_TELEMETRY is off;
 *   - CI is set (CI re-installs would massively inflate the count);
 *   - no ingestion key is configured.
 *
 * Privacy: sends only the package version, Node version, coarse os/arch, a
 * first-install-on-this-machine boolean, and an anonymous per-install UUID (the
 * same id the runtime telemetry uses). Never any path, package contents, or
 * user input.
 *
 * ACCEPTED-ONLY, and what that costs. Until 2026-08-13 this fired unless the
 * user had actively opted out, which meant a first-ever install reported before
 * anyone had been asked — the one place consent did not reach after the CLI
 * grew a first-run question (tools/extenshi-cli/src/telemetry-consent.ts). The
 * gate is now positive, and the consequences are deliberate:
 *   - a FIRST install never pings. Only the CLI's first-run question writes
 *     `telemetry: true`, and that happens on the first RUN, so the earliest
 *     ping is the next upgrade of an accepted machine.
 *   - @extenshi/mcp is headless and never prompts, so it can only ping on a
 *     machine where the CLI recorded consent into the shared config. Treat its
 *     install count as gone, not as a number that dropped.
 *   - `first_extenshi_install` is therefore ~always false now. It is kept so the
 *     event schema does not change under existing PostHog queries, not because
 *     it still measures anything.
 *
 * NB for anyone reading this as an adoption metric: it counts npm EXTRACTIONS,
 * not users. Most of them are ecosystem scanners that install a new version once
 * on a throwaway machine and never run the binary. The "did a client actually
 * launch the server" signal is `mcp_server_started`, emitted from
 * @extenshi/mcp's src/startup.ts — a relative path would be wrong in one of the
 * two packages, since this file is vendored byte-identical into both.
