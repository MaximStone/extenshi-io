# Clean Link — block requests and strip tracking params with declarativeNetRequest

A Manifest V3 blocker: denies requests to domains you list and rewrites
outbound links to remove tracking parameters (`utm_*` and friends) — all as
*declarative* rules the browser network stack evaluates, with no extension
code on the request path.

`rules.json` is the heart of it: a `block` rule by domain pattern and a
`redirect` rule using `queryTransform.removeParams`. The popup toggles the
rule sets at runtime. The
[companion tutorial](https://blog.extenshi.io/posts/declarativenetrequest-block-rewrite-requests-tutorial)
covers the rule syntax, priorities, and why DNR replaced `webRequest` blocking
in MV3.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | MV3; permissions `declarativeNetRequest` (+ `declarativeNetRequestFeedback` for the counters) |
| `rules.json` | Static ruleset: block-by-domain + strip-tracking-params rewrite |
| `popup.html` / `popup.js` | Enable/disable rules and show what's active |
| `service-worker.js` | Rule-set updates and feedback wiring |

## Run it

1. Load the folder via `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**.
2. Try opening a blocked domain — the request is denied by the network stack.
3. Open any page with `?utm_source=…` in a link — the parameter is stripped before the request leaves.

## Permissions

`declarativeNetRequest` for the rules; `declarativeNetRequestFeedback` only
because the popup shows match counts — drop it and the blocker still blocks.
Pure blocking needs no host permissions at all, but this extension also
*rewrites* links, and redirect/modify rules need host access for the origins
involved — that's why `*://*/*` is declared.

MIT, like the rest of this repository.
