# Sample extensions

Complete, loadable extension code from the extenshi.io blog tutorials — the
exact code the articles walk through, kept runnable. Every sample here builds
and loads via the same checker the tutorials are verified with, and was
driven end-to-end in a real Chrome before publishing. Load one via
`chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**.
